# Training Management Framework

This repository contains a comprehensive framework for managing training jobs, resources, and data synthesis in machine learning projects.

## Project Overview

Our training management framework is designed to streamline the process of running machine learning experiments, managing computational resources, and generating synthetic data for training purposes. It provides a robust infrastructure for researchers and data scientists to efficiently conduct their work.

Key features include:

- Job scheduling and management for training runs
- Resource allocation and optimization
- Data synthesis tools for generating high-quality training data
- Integration with popular ML libraries and frameworks
- Monitoring and logging capabilities
